        "0xfa919b49ef34a821fb4cadfdfa5cc6593cb46fe1", value: web3.toWei(2, "ether")})
        
        A> eth.sendTransaction is the command concerned with sending etherium from a node/accout to anohter
        - we define the paramters: 
            * from  --- value ---> the address of the account we want to send from
            * to    --- value ---> the address of the account we want to send to
            * value --- value ---> the amount and type of coin we want to send

        =================================================
        > eth.pendingTransactions
        
        A > this command is concerned with showing the pending transactions between accounts,
        it shows all the transactions to be sent. it's worth mentioning that transactions might have
        some delay, hence it's useful to use this command to check what transactions has finished.
